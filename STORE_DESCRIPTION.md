Tracks your active time on LinkedIn and Facebook, then nudges you to stop scrolling and do something productive.

## Detailed description

Snap Out is a lightweight Chrome extension that helps you break the social media scrolling habit.

HOW IT WORKS

- Dismiss the overlay with "1 more minute" if you need a bit more time

- Works entirely offline
