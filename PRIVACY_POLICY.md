# Privacy Policy for Snap Out

**Last updated:** February 7, 2026

## What data Snap Out collects

Snap Out tracks the amount of **active time** you spend on LinkedIn and Facebook tabs. This timing data is:

- Stored **locally** in the browser's memory while the tab is open
- **Never transmitted** to any server, third party, or external service
- **Discarded** when the tab is closed or the browser is restarted

## Settings data

Your preferences (time limit, custom message, and quick links) are saved using `chrome.storage.sync`, which syncs settings across your signed-in Chrome browsers via your Google account. This is a built-in Chrome feature. Snap Out does not operate or control this sync infrastructure.

No settings data is sent to the developer or any third party.

## Permissions used

- **storage**: To save and sync your preferences (time limit, message, quick links)
- **alarms**: To periodically check elapsed active time

## Data sharing

Snap Out does **not** collect, transmit, sell, or share any user data. It has no analytics, no telemetry, and no network requests.
